Rationality is your middle name; you have no time for frivolous details and need cold hard facts to get your logical cogs turning.

Proud of your ability to make things work, you excel atfinding solutions to problems that others have struggled with. ', 'A natural introvert, you can be uncomfortable in social situations. This extends to group work and can affect your performance as part of a team. You are a quick learner with high standards but are easily frustrated when others cannot keep up or are unprepared.

As an adult, you thrive on specialist knowledge of intricate machinery and can be found across all industries where there is such a need, from fixing power lines to servicing medical equipment.While happy to use your expertise to assist others, you won’t stick around to chat about it: it’s not being helpful that excites you, it’s seeing the problem fixed, your way.', 'You are efficient, patient and task-oriented.

You lack both patience and interest in anyone or anything that doesn’t run at your speed which can make you seem aloof and egotistical. Finding fault is your way of identifying problems to be fixed (preferably by you) but this critical nature makes others feel disparaged.

You feel most at home in museums, universities or other places of research and learning where you can continue to expand your knowledge and mix with like-minded people.', 'Attentive, intuitive and intellectual, you have a great ability to read between the lines and quickly understand what lies beneath, then analyze it. With a natural flair for research you enjoy thinking deeply about human behavior and figuring out how to better understand it. Extremely observant and insightful, you know how to watch, listen and learn. You are an independent thinker and go to great depths to understand your subject, allowing you to form very strong knowledge or research based opinions. Despite your introverted nature, you have the ability to communicate well and enjoy having your work recognized.', 'Your ability to see behind the façade leaves you impatient with those that can’t.

A strong communicator, when you talk, people listen. ', 'Smart, persuasive and analytical, you enjoy learning, investigating, researching and weighing up situations. You have the gift of the gab and once you have found the solution you believe in, you present your arguments in a very convincing manner. Your self-belief, stemming from genuine competency and expert knowledge, gives you strong leadership capabilities. You operate well as both part of a team or an independent player.

An ability to focus intently for long periods of time and a perfectionist streak means you’ll work long and hard to see difficult tasks through to the end—and ensure the results are spot on. Your penchant for rules and procedures gives you a strong moral code with little room for compromise. A “do things right or don’t do them at all” attitude means you are always well-prepared, but never prepared to cut corners.', 'Your preference for predictability and order means management is a challenge for you: people, unlike numbers, are an unknown quantity. Because you think methodically, you also methodically find fault and can be critical of those around you. Your passion for accuracy and deliberation can be taken to the extreme and you can come across as pedantic.

Your warm heart and open nature make you an excellent listener. You accept others as they are and strongly believe everyone has a right to their own culture, beliefs and way of life.
