Nuclear technicians also work in waste management and treatment facilities, where they monitor the disposal, recycling, and storage of nuclear waste. They perform duties similar to those of radiation protection technicians at nuclear power plants.
Other nuclear technicians work in laboratories. They help nuclear physicists, nuclear engineers, and other scientists conduct research and develop new types of nuclear reactors, fuels, medicines, and other technologies. They use equipment such as radiation detectors, spectrometers (used to measure gamma ray and x-ray radiation), and particle accelerators to conduct experiments and gather data. 
They also may use remote-controlled equipment to manipulate radioactive materials or materials exposed to radiation. Most nuclear technicians work full time, in power plants, which operate 24 hours a day. Technicians may work variable schedules that include nights, holidays, and weekends. Occasionally, plants stop operations for maintenance and upgrades. Workers may need to work overtime during these periods.

",`career_how`="Nuclear technicians typically enter the occupation with an associate’s degree in nuclear science or a nuclear-related technology. Nuclear technicians also go through extensive on-site job training. For safety and security reasons, nuclear technicians usually must undergo a background check and receive some type of security clearance after they are hired. Nuclear technicians typically enter the occupation with an associate’s degree, or after gaining equivalent experience in the Armed Forces, specifically the U.S. Navy.

Physicists can work in either applied or theoretical physics, based on their skill set and available career opportunities. Most careers in physics require graduate-level education, especially in applied physics.
 Many careers in physics involve research. Theoretical physics, which is much more abstract and uses mathematical equations to explain the physical world around us, has less direct influence on current affairs. Although advancements in theoretical physics are incredibly important scientifically, fewer jobs are available. 
Physicists explore the fundamental properties and laws that govern space, time, energy, and matter. Some physicists study theoretical areas, such as the fundamental properties of atoms and molecules and the evolution of the universe. Others design and perform experiments with sophisticated equipment such as particle accelerators, electron microscopes, and lasers. Through observation and analysis, they try to discover and formulate laws that explain the forces of nature, such as gravity, electromagnetism, and nuclear interactions. Others apply their knowledge of physics to practical areas, such as the development of advanced materials and medical equipment.

Toolmakers craft precision tools and tool holders that are used to cut, shape, and form metal and other materials. They also produce jigs and fixtures that hold metal while it is poured, stamped, or drilled, and gauges other measuring devices. 
Die makers construct metal forms, called dies, that are used to shape metal in stamping and forging operations. They also make metal molds for die-casting and for molding plastics, ceramics, and composite materials. Many tool and die makers use CADs to develop products and parts. Specifications entered into computer programs can be used to electronically develop blueprints for the required tools and dies. 
Computer numeric control programmers use CAD and CAM programs to convert electronic drawings into CAM-based computer programs that contain instructions for a sequence of cutting tool operations. Once these programs are developed, CNC machines follow the set of instructions contained in the program to produce the part. 
Machinists normally operate CNC machines, but tool and die makers are often trained to both operate CNC machines and write CNC programs, and they may do either task.

After a setter prepares a machine for production, an operator observes the machine and the products it makes. Operators may have to load the machine with materials for production or adjust the machine’s speeds during production. They must periodically inspect the parts a machine produces. If they detect a minor problem, operators may fix it themselves. Job duties generally vary with the size of the manufacturer and the type of machine being operated. Although some workers specialize in one or two types of machinery, many are trained to set up or operate a variety of machines. 
Increasing automation allows machine operators to control multiple machines at the same time. Metal and plastic machine workers are employed mostly in factories.  These workers often operate powerful, high-speed machines that can be dangerous, so they must observe safety rules. Operators usually wear protective equipment, such as safety glasses, to protect them from flying particles of metal or plastic, earplugs to guard against noise from the machines, and steel-toed boots, to shield their feet from heavy objects.

They drive long-distance trains and commuter trains. Most locomotive engineers drive diesel-electric engines, although some drive locomotives powered by battery or electricity. Engineers must be aware of the goods their train is carrying because different types of freight require different types of driving, based on the conditions of the rails. For example, a train carrying hazardous material though a snowstorm is driven differently than a train carrying coal though a mountain region. 
Locomotive engineers typically monitor speed, air pressure, battery use, and other instruments to ensure that the locomotive runs smoothly. They use a variety of controls, such as throttles and airbrakes, to operate the train. They communicate with dispatchers over radios to get information about delays or changes in the schedule. Trains are scheduled to operate 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, meaning that many railroad workers sometimes work nights, weekends, and holidays. Most rail employees work full time. Federal regulations require a minimum number of rest hours for train operators.

During training, an engineer learns the track length, where the switches are, and any unusual features of the track. An experienced engineer who switches to a new route also has to spend a few months in training to learn the route with an engineer who is familiar with it. In addition, railroad companies provide continuing education so that engineers can maintain their skills.

UPDATE `jobsinfo` SET `career_what`="A urologist is a physician who specializes in diseases of the urinary tract for both men and women.   Urologists specifically emphasize the male reproductive system.  This can include diseases affecting the bladder, urethra, ureters, kidneys, and adrenal glands, along with the epididymis, penis, prostate, seminal vesicles and testes specifically in men.   While it emphasizes study of the male reproductive system, it also includes study of the female urinary track and female reproductive system.   
Urologists treat conditions with medical management or surgery, depending on the nature of the condition that is presented to them.  Although it is generally classified as a surgical specialty, urologists require knowledge of other specialties such as gynecology and internal medicine due to the wide variety of clinical problems that they have to deal with.  The American Urological Association (AUA) has identified seven subspecialties that comprise the field of urology.   These sub-specialties include the treatment of kidney stones in the urinary track, female urinary bladder control, male infertility, and male erectile dysfunction. They also treat urinary disorders in children, may be involved in kidney transplants, and treat cancers of the bladder and prostate.
Urology is a constantly changing specialty, primarily due to advances made to technology.  Refinements to endoscopic procedures and the utilization of the surgical microscope have greatly increased urologists' options.  Laparoscopic surgery and chemotherapy are effecting how treatment is administered. Laser therapy promises to become an important part of future urologic practice.
